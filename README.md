## Annual Sales Report Generator
*Small Python project completed while attending VWCC*

* Created using Python 3.1
* Makes use of opening and reading data from a separate text file

**Assignment parameters were as follows:**
"You’ve been hired by the Brookfield Electronics to create an annual sales report for all of its sales personnel. The data are stored in a text file called SalesData.txt; records in the file are organized with the sale person’s name (last, first format: Bunker, Archie) followed by 12 records containing sales for each month January through December. For extra credit list the employees in alphabetical order in the report.

For each employee list the name (ex. Archie Bunker), total annual sales, total commission, and bonus amount earned for the year. At the end of the report, total each column of figures. Also report the average total annual sales and the sales persons with the highest and lowest total annual sales. Note you are changing the name from a lastname, firstname format to firstname lastname.

Commission is based on total annual sales. For total sales below $3000, commission is 1.5% of sales; for $3000 to $5000 commission is 2.5% of sales; for $5000 to $7000, commission is 4%; for $7000 and above, commission is 6.25%. Bonus is earned only if the total annual sale for a sale person is at least $5000. The bonus is 3.75% of total sales of the year. For sales personnel not earning a bonus, print “No Bonus” instead of $0 in the report."

#### To execute:
The file is command line executable, so within your CMI, ```cd``` to the location of the files, then run ```python proj_three.py```
